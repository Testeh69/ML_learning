ML AND AI

Machine learning is a subfield of AI that depend heavily on data science (How to handle data).
There are 3 common types of algorithms in machine learning:

-Supervised learning: where the data is labeled, we have input and output
   
   =>Two types of problems:
   
       -Classification: predict discrete values (binary classification and multiclass classification) like knn, Naive Bayes, Logistic regression, Neural network and so on.
       
       -Regression: predict continous values like linear regression, neural network

-Unsupervised learning: where the computer determined features through the data that we feed in and gathered into various groups depending on these features

-Reinforcement learning: Agent learning in interactive environnment based on rewards and penalties.

Dataset is split into 3 dataset => Training Dataset, Validation Dataset and testing Dataset


NEURAL NETWORK

1) The principal of a neural networks:

A neural network is composed of layers of "neurons", the first layers is the input layers depend on how many dimensions of features we have and the last layers depend on how many output we have. Between this two layers there layers called hidden layers.

We use activation function like "sigmoid", "tanh", "relu" so that the neural networks is not linear(not sure on how to describe how this part is important).(Modification 31/07/2023): So this important because the model can learn non-linear pattern.

2) Neural Networks for linear regression problem:

We use as a input layers a normalization layers so that all features should be on a similar scales. The most common types is features scaling which means that we set the dataset to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

Note ML:

The computer does not understand letters so we have to convert letters into numbers.
