ML AND AI

Machine learning is a subfield of AI that depend heavily on data science (How to handle data).
There is 3 common types of algorithms in machine learning:
-Supervised learning: where the data are labeled, we have input and output
   =>Two types of problems:
       -Classification: predict discrete values (binary classification and multiclass classification) like knn, Naive Bayes, Logistic regression, Neural network and so on.
       -Regression: predict continous values like linear regression, neural network
-Unsurpervised learning: where the computer determined features through the data that we feed in and gather into various group depending on this features
-Reinforcement learning: Agent learning in interactiveenvironnment based on rewards and penalties.

Data set is split into 3 data set => Training Data set, Validation data_set and testing data set


NEURAL NETWORK

1)the principal of a neural networks:

A neural network is composed of layers of "neurones", the first layers is the input layers depend on how many dimensions of features we have and the last layers depend on how many output we have. Between this two layers there layers called hidden layers.

We use activation fonction like "sigmoid", "tanh", "relu" so that the neural networks is not linear(not sure on how to describe how this par is important).


Note ML:
The computer does not understand letters so we have to convert letters into numbers.






Note: I am a french student, that studies AI during his free times. There can be some erros. If you see some erros tell me via email: norefice45@gmail.com
